We are a team of 5 working on mainlining various Nokia & Microsoft Lumia phones.

Because these devices were originally shipped with Windows Phone, it's a slightly different process to most mainlined phones.

We currently have atleast basic support for all Lumia devices based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset, and a few Lumia devices based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 chipset.
